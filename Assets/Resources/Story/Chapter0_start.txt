Gwynne "Raelin, if you spoke to who I think you spoke to..." move(Gwynne,0.93) setFace(Gwynne,normA) setBody(Gwynne,specialA)

"As I look on at the sky, I see a glowing shape." playSound(starFalling)
"A streak of light is going across the sky, a great trail of luminous ribbons following it."
"It's enormous too. Almost as if it is swallowing the entire night."
"One of the old legends I had read as a child described a serpent which ate the night sky."
"I can't help but think of that as the glowing streak comes down towards the earth."
"As I look on in wonder, the streak begins to grow larger and larger."
"Something... is falling from the sky itself."
"But that couldn't be possible. It can't happen."
"It's never happened before."
"But my eyes do not lie. Something is falling."
"Never before have I seen such a sight."
"It's burning too. A great, flaming star is dropping from the heavens."
"The entire sky is filled with its light now. It's as if the sun had appeared in the night sky."
"My eyes open wide as I recall that nobelwoman's words."

"One day, one of those stars will fall. One day..."

"...She must have known this was coming!"
"The very ground beneath me shakes as the star draws closer and closer to the ground"
"Armor plates and weapon racks begin to rattle too."
"Wait, what if it hits the capital?!"
"Would we all be destroyed?"
"No, I won't panic."
"I have to keep my cool in the face of any situation."
"There's nothing I can do but hope that it doesn't hit us."
"To my relief, it doesn't appear to be heading towards the capital."
"Plummeting towards the earth, I can hear the thundering crack of its impact somewhere beyond the city."

"It's enough to make the entire barracks wake up."
"Panicked voices echo through the hall, everyone immediately reaching for their armor."

Gwynne "What was that noise, Raelin?!"

Raelin "It was a star falling from the heavens!"

Gwynne "A star? Can that happen?"
"I've never heard of this happening before."

narrator "It's true. I've never heard of anything falling from the sky like this before."
"Is it an omen of some sort? I can't say for sure."

Gwynne "You know what this means..."

narrator "It was an omen."
"The panic in the barracks begins to worsen."
"Arms and armor are being wildly thrown on."
"It's not long before everyone is standing to attention."

Gwynne "Raelin, I would get to your bed..."
"Keira will be walking in here at any moment."

narrator "But I can't tear my eyes away from the sky."
"A terrible sense of dread fills my entire being."
"What is going to come of this star?"
"There's too many questions I don't know the answer to."
